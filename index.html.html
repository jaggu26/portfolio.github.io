    <h3><span>Title: </span>Fabrication of Brinnel Hardness Testing Machine</h3>
    <h3><span>Description: </span>The aim of this work was to design and invent Brinell hardness testing machine for
in-house testing and used for evaluation of hardness properties of soft materials. In this
representation, Coated-Wood-Free (CWF) paper with grammage at 300 grams were used as the
sample, whereas, the indenter diameter and the dwell time of imprinting were used at 7.86 mm
and 10 seconds, respectively. After that, the hardness values were determined by using the
principle of Brinell Hardness Number (BHN). This report presented the mean and the deviation
of quantification that measured by this equipment and the focused parameter were included
active weight loading, imprinted diameter, and BHN, respectively. Finally, the consequences of
this analysis were discussed for development of this apparatus.</h3>
